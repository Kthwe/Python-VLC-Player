# Python-VLC-Player

This program require VLC Media Player in advance. It will need Pyinstaller to convert to executable file for best performance. Recommended command line is *path/to/pyinstaller.exe player_tk.py --icon=icon12.ico --onefile --noconsole*. Once done, drag and drop the video from desired path to start playing. It will automatically load all video. *Up key* is to select file to favoured path named Up. The concept goes for all the arrow keys. Plus, *1-9 keys* also works with the same principle.
